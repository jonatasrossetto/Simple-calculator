Simple Calculator in JS
This is a homemade project to create a simple calculator using JavaScript
The first goal is to implement the four basic functions with integer numbers

14/04/2022 - Simple buttons, trying to implement add functionality, still very basic
18/04/2022 - Still very simple, but now it implements the 4 operations and behaves a little bit more like a real calculator

20/04/2022 - Some code refactoring

30/04/2022 - Clear and Clear Entry buttons were implemented, a status button was implemented to show the calculator's internal values
